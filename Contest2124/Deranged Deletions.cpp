            # Or take the entire array if possible
            pass

        # Alternative approach: the only way a derangement is possible is if the array has at least one element that is not in its original position in the sorted array
        # So if the array is not already sorted, then there exists some derangement
        # But the sample input shows that [2,2,3] is not a derangement (sorted is [2,2,3], so positions 2 and 3 match)
        # So the condition is more strict: after sorting, no element in the original array matches the sorted array's element at any position

        # So the solution is to find any subarray (with order preserved) where none of the elements match the sorted subarray's elements
        # So for the sample input 2: [4,5,5,2,4], sorted is [2,4,4,5,5]. Comparing:
        # Original: 4 5 5 2 4
        # Sorted:  2 4 4 5 5
        # Positions: 1:4!=2, 2:5!=4, 3:5!=4, 4:2!=5,5:4!=5 â†’ all different, so it's a derangement
        # So the answer is YES, and the original array is acceptable

        # So the first step is to check if the original array is a derangement
        # If not, then we need to see if removing some elements can make it a derangement
        # So for the array a, we can try to find a subset of size k (1 <=k <=n) where the property holds

            # But since the problem allows any valid solution, maybe we can find one greedily
            # So perhaps the first such subarray found can be returned
            # So for example, we can try to exclude elements that are in their correct positions in the sorted array
            pass

        # Alternative idea: the answer is YES if the array contains at least one element that is not the smallest element
        # But the first sample input has elements [2,2,3], which includes 3 (not smallest), but the entire array's sorted version is [2,2,3], which has the third element matching. So the entire array is not a derangement. But if we remove one 2, the array becomes [2,3], sorted is [2,3], which has 2 in the first position matching. So no derangement possible. Hence, the answer is NO.

        # So perhaps the only way is to find if there's any subset of the array where, when sorted, no element matches the original's elements
        # This seems hard to check without brute force for small n
