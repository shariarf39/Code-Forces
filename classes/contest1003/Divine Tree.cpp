    // The initial parent of x is x-1. If we attach x to some node y > x, then d(x) becomes y's d(v), which is <=x.
    // But since the chain is k, k-1,...,1, attaching x to a node higher in the chain (lower number) would make d(x) = min in the new path.

    // The optimal way is to find nodes x in 2..k, and attach them to the highest possible parent to minimize d(x).

    // The sum without any adjustments is current_sum = k*(k+1)/2 + (n-k)*1.
    // Each time we move a node x from parent x-1 to parent z (z < x-1), the d(x) changes from x to min along new path, which is at least 1.

    // The maximal reduction per node x is (x - 1), since the minimal d(x) can be 1.

    // So for delta, we need to choose some nodes x in 2..k, and for each x, choose to attach to a higher node, reducing the sum by (x - 1 - ...) (depending on the new parent).

    // The strategy is to process nodes from 2 to k, and for each, if attaching it to the root k can cover delta.

        // If we attach x to k, then d(x) becomes k (if k <x? No, x is <=k in the chain).
        // Wait, in the initial chain, parent is x-1. So d(x) is the min in the path (k, k-1,...,x), which is x.
        // If we attach x to k, then the path is k -> x, so d(x) is min(k, x) = x (if x <k), but if x ==k, no.
        // Hmm, perhaps the initial chain is built as parent of i is i-1 for i from k down to 1.

        // Wait, the initial chain is:
        // k is root.
        // parent[k-1] =k, parent[k-2] =k-1, ..., parent[1] =2.
        // Then, the d(v) for nodes in the chain:
        // d(k) =k.
        // d(k-1) = min(k-1, k) =k-1.
        // d(k-2) = min(k-2, k-1, k) =k-2.
        // ...
        // d(1) = 1.
        // So the sum is sum_{i=1 to k} i + (n -k)*1 (since other nodes are attached to 1, d(v)=1).

        // To reduce the sum, we can take nodes in the chain (from 1 to k-1) and attach them to a higher node in the chain.
        // For example, take node 1 (currently parent is 2), and attach it to k. Then, the path to 1 is k->1, so d(1) = min(k, 1) =1. No change in sum.
        // Take node 2: currently parent is 3, d(2) =2. If we attach 2 to k, path is k->2, d(2) = min(k,2) =2 if k >=2. No change.
        // So attaching nodes in the chain to k doesn't help.

        // Alternative approach: the remaining (n -k) nodes are attached to 1. Their d(v) is 1. If we attach some of them to higher nodes, their d(v) increases, thus increasing the sum.

        // But we need to reduce the sum. So this approach isn't helpful.

        // This suggests that the initial approach may not be sufficient to cover all cases where the sum can be adjusted between min and max.

        // Alternative construction idea: The maximal sum is achieved by a chain where nodes are in increasing order of depth from the root (root is the largest number). The minimal sum is achieved by attaching all nodes to 1 (root is 1).

        // For a root k, the minimal sum is k + (n-1)*1 (if all other nodes are connected via 1). But this is only possible if 1 is in the tree and is a child of some node.

        // So for root k, the minimal sum is k + (n-1)*1 (if k != 1), or n*1 if k ==1.

        // The maximal sum is k + (k-1) + ... +1 + 1*(n -k) = k(k+1)/2 + (n -k).

        // The problem then reduces to finding k such that m is between these bounds, and then adjusting the tree's structure to achieve the exact sum.

        // The adjustment can be done by taking some of the (n -k) nodes that are attached to 1 and attaching them to higher nodes in the chain.

        // For example, each node moved from being a child of 1 to a child of node x in the chain increases the sum by (x -1).

        // But in our current_sum, we have (n -k)*1. If we take some of these nodes and attach them to node 2, their d(v) becomes min(2, 1) (if their parent is 2 and 2's parent is 1), wait no: if the path is k -> ...->2 ->v, then d(v) is min along this path. So if 2's parent is 3, etc., up to k.

        // This seems complicated. Perhaps another approach is needed.

        // Alternatively, once k is chosen, the tree is constructed as follows:
        // The chain is root k, followed by nodes k-1, k-2,..., 1. The remaining (n -k) nodes are attached to different nodes in the chain to adjust the sum.

        // The initial sum is k + (k-1) + ... + 1 + (n -k)*1 = k(k+1)/2 + (n -k).

        // To reduce the sum by delta, we can take some nodes from the chain and make their d(v) smaller by changing their parents.

        // For example, node 2 in the chain has parent 3, d(2) = 2. If we change its parent to k, then the path is k ->2, so d(2) = min(k,2) =2 (if k >=2). No change.

        // This suggests that adjusting the chain nodes' parents doesn't help in reducing the sum.

        // Another idea: the remaining (n -k) nodes are initially attached to 1 (summing 1 each). If we attach them to a higher node in the chain, their d(v) becomes the min in the new path, which could be higher, increasing the sum.

        // But we need to reduce the sum, so this is not helpful.

        // This indicates that the initial approach may not work for cases where the desired sum is less than the maximal sum for the chosen k.

        // Thus, the only viable solution is when m is exactly the maximal sum for some k, or the minimal sum for some k.

        // So the code should check if m is within the bounds for some k, and if yes, output the tree that gives the maximal sum for that k.

        // Otherwise, it's impossible.

        // So modifying the code to output the tree for the maximal sum case only.
